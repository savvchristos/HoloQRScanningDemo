A video player plugin for Unity WebGL applications. Unity's builtin VideoPlayer can struggle to work with WebGL builds especially on mobile browsers. This package uses Web-native video elements to read the video source and exposes basic video controls to Unity.
You can use video URLs either from `StreamingAssets` path or web servers (permissing CORS). While minimal, the plugin aims to be a complete video player for web across browsers and platforms. Key features include:
- Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, (Un)Mute, APIs along with respective callback events.
- Resampling of source video texture to preserve aspect ratio or arbitrarly stretch to match target texture size.
- Fetch and set video player timestamps.
- Supports both in-built and scriptable rendering pipeline.
